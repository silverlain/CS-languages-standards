# IT-2-Standards
This repository documents a variety of IT standards such as programming languages and protocols. These make up the "common language" of IT which allows for standardized computing development and communications between computers and humans. These standards represent standardized ways of using hardware to implement the computing paradigms in the knowledge layer below it. New standards are constantly being developed as paradigms evolve, while older ones are updated or phased out.
